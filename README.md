# Distributions and LDA
Developed in the Computational Statistics course by: Javier Mendoza and Kevin Reyes.
## Objectives
- Visualize the approximation of a continuous probability distribution with a discrete one.
- Relate the approximation error with the parameter of number of approximation rectangles.
- Study the effect of sample size on the approximation error.
- Evaluate linear frontiers of LDA in non-linear frontiers of bivariate normal distributions.

## Description
Study of approximations of continuous probability distributions with discrete ones, approximation error, effect of sample size and evaluation of linear frontiers of LDA in non-linear frontiers.

## Conclusions
- As the sample size increases, the shape of the distribution approaches the theoretical model.
- The error in the mean tends to be very high for very small sample sizes.
- The linear borders of LDA can approximate simple nonlinear borders, as long as the data are not superimposed, in such cases, the error is considerable.
